                    <p>
                        This was the driving force that led Logistic Padala Express to a successful acquisition of an ISO 9001:2015 Certification for being an outstanding logistics company in the Philippines.

                        On October 21, 2019, Logistic was recommended to be ISO 9001:2015 Certified by DNV-GL after being able to comply with the ISO 9001: 2015 standards. This is a milestone for the company, having been awarded this prestigious international certification after just eight years in operation. In October 2022, we were re-certified again, as a testament to our commitment to excellence

                    <p>
                        ISO 9001:2015 is the latest version of the internationally accepted standard for quality management and recognizes organizations with a quality management system. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being ISO certified helps Logistic provide services that follow international standards to fulfill our customers’ requirements.

                    <p>
                        This means you can expect nothing less than the best from Logistic's cargo and logistics services.
